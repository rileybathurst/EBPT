        <h2>Jessica, PT.</h2>
        <p class="justified-40">
          I first became interested in physical therapy after observing my
          dad&apos;s treatments following knee surgery. I was intrigued by
          physical therapy&apos;s use of exercise to help improve overall
          function. I began working as a physical therapy aide and later
          received my Master&apos;s degree in Physical Therapy from Northern
          Illinois University in 2011.
        </p>

        <p class="justified-40">
          After working as a PT in Illinois for a little over a year, I began my
          search for places that could support my active lifestyle (water
          skiing, wake boarding, and snowboarding). Photos of Tahoe in snowboard
          magazines always seemed to catch my eye! I moved to Tahoe in 2013 and
          began working at Emerald Bay Physical Therapy.
        </p>

        <p class="justified-40">
          In January 2021, I purchased ownership of EBPT to further lay roots in
          Tahoe and provide the community with expert care in a private setting.
          I believe the key factors that lead to successful physical therapy are
          quality time, active listening, and hands-on treatments. Every
          treatment plan&apos;s foundational components are listening to each
          patient&apos;s complaints and goals, using critical thinking to find
          the causes, and utilizing manual techniques. Using these fundamental
          building blocks ensures progress with every patient.
        </p>

        <p class="justified-40">
          I strive to provide the best possible care by attending various
          continuing education courses. I have advanced my knowledge in the
          recent past by taking classes regarding cervical and scapular
          dysfunction treatment, myofascial release, and RockTape Kinesio-
          taping. I have attended lectures about extremity mobilization,
          shoulder biomechanics, and even earned my Pilates Level 1 Mat
          Instruction certificate.
        </p>

        <p class="justified-40">
          I look forward to deepening my South Shore roots while providing
          individualized, specialized, and reliable care to my friends and
          neighbors. At Emerald Bay Physical Therapy, we are committed to health
          and wellness no matter your age, lifestyle, or athletic abilities. I
          look forward to meeting you!

          I have been a resident of South Lake Tahoe since 1998, one of those
          who "came for a winter" and never left. I had an interest in PT toward
          the end of high school, but chose architecture as my major in college
          and worked in the field for several years before realizing it was not
          for me. Being a PT patient through several injuries in the early 2000s
          renewed my interest in becoming a PT, and I decided to follow through
          by working as a PT Tech at Emerald Bay PT while taking prerequisite
          classes at LTCC. I completed my Doctorate in Physical Therapy at Emory
          University in 2014 and have been practicing in the Tahoe area ever
          since.
        </p>

        <p class="justified-40">
          With a background in high school soccer, gymnastics, swimming, and
          diving as well as competitive snowboarding and snowboard instruction,
          I understand the fundamentals of a wide variety of sports. I currently
          spend as much time as possible outdoors snowboarding, hiking,
          backpacking, climbing, and paddle boarding.
        </p>

        <p class="justified-40">
          I am grateful for the chance to be part of the team here at Emerald
          Bay PT, as I subscribe to the philosophy of quality time, hands on
          treatment, and individualized care that is the norm in this clinic. I
          make a concerted effort to get to know each patient and seek to set
          goals and align treatment to help an individual return to their usual
          activities rather than achieving standardized measurements.
        </p>

        <p class="justified-40">
          I have obtained certification in Vestibular Rehabilitation to address
          dizziness and balance disorders, in addition to certification in LSVT
          BIG treatment for Parkinson's Disease. I am certified with RockTape
          for basic and advanced kinesiology taping, RockBlades, RockPods, and
          RockFloss for manual treatments, and am a certified Clinical
          Instructor for Student Physical Therapists.

          I have had the pleasure of working as a Physical Therapy Aide at EBPT
          for just over 5 years. I grew up in a small town in Iowa with a love
          for dance and a fascination with how our bodies move. I came to Tahoe
          in 2008 after attending school in Southern California. Like so many
          others, I ended up staying and making Tahoe my home. I enjoy all of
          the beauty and outdoor activities Tahoe has to offer, and I share your
          love for this special place we call home. I always knew I wanted to
          work in healthcare, and my job at EBPT has been more fulfilling than I
          could have ever imagined. I hope to provide our patients with a
          welcoming environment where they feel at ease and maybe even a little
          excited about coming to PT! I look forward to helping our patients,
          from any age and activity level, get stronger and move better so they
          can get back to doing what they love.

          South shore local since 2005, I have had the great pleasure of joining
          the EBPT team. In 2007, I was on the South Tahoe high tennis team,
          when I tore my meniscus during a match. I was terrified about surgery
          and did not know I had any other options, until I was introduced to
          physical therapy. Learning what I could do to heal my body through
          exercises and stretching was life changing. Physical therapy was a
          success and prevented me from having to undergo knee surgery. After
          that I became fascinated learning about all the things the human body
          is capable of. I received my education in nutrition and personal
          training at LTCC, and I enjoy helping people in the community through
          local gyms and private consultations for nutrition. I am a
          bodybuilding enthusiast and have competed in a few regional
          competitions since 2019. I love teaching others how to move the body
          and teaching them what's possible. Healing can be a difficult process
          which is best overcome by education, encouragement, communication and
          engagement. EBPT is the perfect place to regain lost mobility and
          function because we care about getting you back to what you love; no
          matter the age, lifestyle, or activity level.
