          <h3>
            How do I begin physical therapy treatment? Do you require a referral
            and/or a prescription?
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              California law allows licensed physical therapists to treat you
              without obtaining a referral from your doctor.
            </li>
            <li>
              Please keep in mind â€“ after 12 visits or 45 days (whichever comes
              first), a doctor must sign off on any further treatment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>NOTE:</b> While we can see you without a prescription or
              referral, your insurance network may still require a referral to
              cover the costs of your visits. Please contact your insurance
              provider prior to your first visit to determine whether your
              health plan requires a referral to ensure coverage.
            </li>
            <li>
              Contact our clinic to make an appointment for an evaluation.
            </li>
            <li>Fill out our new patient intake forms.</li>
            <li>
              A referral is <b>NOT</b> required for independent exercise
              programs.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What if my referral is to a different therapist/ clinic?</h3>
          <p>
            We can accept any prescription for physical therapy. We recommend
            communicating with your doctor regarding your preference for Emerald
            Bay Physical Therapy.
          </p>

          <h3>What do I wear?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We suggest that you wear loose fitting clothing like something you
              might wear to the gym and something that makes the area we are
              treating easily accessible.
            </li>
            <li>
              Comfortable shoes are suggested, like jogging or walking shoes.
              High heels, slip-ons, and boots are not recommended.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pool patients should bring a swimsuit or a t-shirt and shorts to
              change into before beginning aquatic therapy.
            </li>
            <li>Changing area available.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What should I bring to my first visit?</h3>
          <p>Please bring the following to your 1st appointment:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Original prescription/referral from your physician (if required)
            </li>
            <li>Insurance card or other insurance information</li>
            <li>Office co-pay (if applicable)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What should I expect during my first visit?</h3>
          <p>
            During your first appointment you will meet your physical therapist
            and speak with them regarding your symptoms, functional limitations,
            and your goals. Your physical therapist will perform tests and
            measures including range of motion and muscle strength in order to
            set up your treatment. You can also expect to receive treatment
            during your first appointment which will typically include manual
            therapy and instruction on exercise.
          </p>

          <h3>What might my treatment involve?</h3>
          <p>
            Your treatment will typically involve hands-on manual therapy,
            exercise, and modalities. Exercises can include stretching,
            strengthening, core stabilization, and postural reeducation. Your
            exercise program will be individually tailored to address your
            functional limitations and goals. Modalities may include electrical
            stimulation, moist heat, ice, and traction. If you are scheduled for
            aquatic therapy, you will perform a series of stretching and
            strengthening exercises in the pool, possibly using the current,
            handheld paddles, water weights, or other tools.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What can I do to speed up my recovery time? Will I be given a home
            exercise program?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Patients are typically given a home exercise program on one of their
            first visits. It is important to follow your program on the days
            that you do not come to therapy unless otherwise instructed by the
            therapist.
          </p>

          <h3>
            How frequently will I be going? How long will my appointments take?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Your doctor and your therapist determine the frequency of your
            therapy. It is common for patients to come 2 or 3 times per week for
            4 to 6 weeks to start out with.
          </p>
          <p>
            A typical appointment will last approximately 1 hour. This varies
            per patient and per injury.

          <h2>Insurance Questions</h2>

          <h3>Is my insurance accepted?</h3>
          <p>
            We accept most PPO insurance plans, Medicare, and most Medicare
            Secondary Insurance plans. We <b>DO NOT</b> accept Medi-Cal or most
            HMO insurance plans. Please contact your insurance provider directly
            to confirm your coverage for physical therapy treatment.
          </p>

          <h3>What will my insurance cover?</h3>
          <p>
            This will vary per insurance plan. Three common terms you will hear
            in relation to your insurance coverage are{" "}
            <b>deductibles, co-pays</b>, and <b>co-insurance</b>. A{" "}
            <b>deductible</b> is a sum which the insurance company requires you
            to pay out of pocket before they will begin coverage. A{" "}
            <b>co-pay</b> is a set amount you pay for each visit. A{" "}
            <b>co-insurance</b> payment is a percentage of the charges for which
            you are responsible after the insurance company has paid their
            portion. One or two of these terms will probably apply to your
            insurance. Insurance will not cover independent programs offered at
            EBPT such as the water exercise programs, swim lessons, personal
            training, and non-prescribed massage therapy.
          </p>

          <h3>How do I use my work compensation insurance?</h3>
          <p>
            Your adjuster and/ or nurse case manager will coordinate with us and
            with you to determine your physical therapy treatment. We will
            contact the insurance company for authorization to begin and
            continue your therapy.
          </p>

          <h3>
            How do I make payments? Will you accept payment plans? Is a payment
            required at each visit?
          </h3>
          <p>
            This depends on your insurance coverage. If you have a deductible
            that has not yet been satisfied, we will request you to pay up to
            the amount of the deductible as the charges are accrued. For
            co-insurance payments, you will receive a bill after your insurance
            has paid its portion. These can be paid through the mail, over the
            phone, or by coming in to the office. If your insurance plan
            requires a co-pay, we ask that you pay those on each visit.
