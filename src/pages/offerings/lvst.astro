            LSVT BIG trains people with Parkinson&apos;s to move their bodies
            normally. As the disease progresses, movements get smaller and
            slower, yet feel normal to the involved person. This causes problems
            with dressing and other tasks for self-care, usual household chores,
            and walking. The program focuses on recalibrating the brain to
            understand what normal movement is.
          </p>

          <p>
            The treatment involves 4 consecutive weeks of attending PT 4 days a
            week to develop a habit of performing a series of exercises with the
            aim of improving a person&apos;s ability to move in and out of bed,
            stand up and sit down, get in and out of cars and buildings, and
            walk, as well as improving fine motor skills such as tying shoelaces
            or buttoning a shirt.
          </p>

          <p>
            Studies have shown the LSVT BIG system consistently drives
            improvement for people at all stages of Parkinson&apos;s Disease.
            Quality of life is improved by allowing people to function more
            independently. Come see us and find out if this treatment is
            appropriate for you!
