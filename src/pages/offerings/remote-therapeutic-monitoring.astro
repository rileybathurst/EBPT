          Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM) is a service to provide patient
          treatment and monitoring by remote means. Once enrolled, patients will
          be emailed a link from Exercise Pro Live to download the
          &apos;Exercise Now&apos; app or continue in the web based portal. The
          system will provide access to a detailed home exercise program where
          the patient can enter their sets, repetitions, and weight. The patient
          can also comment on pain levels, difficulty of the exercise, as well
          as directly message their therapist. Benefits of RTM:
          <ul>
            <li>Increased patient engagement and adherence to treatment</li>
            <li>Reduced number of trips to the clinic</li>
            <li>
              Therapist can better understand the patient&apos;s response to
              treatment and adjust accordingly
            </li>
            <li>Easy communication between the therapist and patient</li>
            <li>Medicare approved</li>
