          <p>
            If you suffer from dizziness or balance problems, vestibular
            rehabilitation may offer the help you need. In addition, dizziness
            and balance issues can lead to headaches and / or muscle fatigue.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most common type of dizziness is Benign Paroxysmal Positional
            Vertigo (BPPV), triggered by movement and recognized by short bouts
            (one minute or less) where it seems like the world is spinning. It
            involves the inner ear, and can usually be resolved within 1-3 visits
            of PT.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are more involved conditions where spinning dizziness lasts for
            longer than a minute or the dizziness does not feel like spinning -
            many of these conditions can also be treated with Vestibular PT.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vestibular Rehabilitation can also treat balance disorders, stroke,
            traumatic brain injury, Meniere&apos;s disease, and other conditions by
            addressing posture, strength, stability, and gait. Training the brain
            to coordinate with surroundings is also a useful treatment strategy.
