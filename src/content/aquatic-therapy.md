Aquatic therapy is conducted in a swimming pool that is temperature controlled. It can allow a person to perform movements at an earlier stage of rehabilitation due to reduced weight-bearing from the buoyancy of the water. There is resistance in every direction from moving through the water, while the warmth and compression encourage circulation and increase the comfort level for movement.

Activities can include cardiovascular, conditioning, and strengthening exercises using the current, paddles, or other available tools to increase resistance.
