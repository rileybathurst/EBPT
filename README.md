# EBPT

Netlify build from
https://github.com/rileybathurst/EBPT

The intake forms and images are host on S3, this needs better documentation



# Updates changes and thoughts

- Google Search Console and Analytics
- Hero logo, maybe closer to the circle and the hero image smaller
- bring some sizing down on the fonts for lists etc
- front page section titles are too big
- I need a lot of work on the typefaces, lets go with just Sofia Pro?
- when the menu opens and closes it should go darker
- safari doesn't have flex gap which is breaking two-fold
- Im running the treating image in the gatsby-config be careful when deleating that and check on things
- could be weird overkill but it's probably pretty easy to check the time in california and add an open or closed to the hours
