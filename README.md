# EBPT

Netlify build from
https://github.com/rileybathurst/EBPT

The intake forms are slightly different as I don't have them going through the gatsby build
They are hosted on a manual deploy netlify build
https://ebpt-pdfs.netlify.app
Navigate to the /src/forms
Make any changes
On netlify https://app.netlify.com/sites/ebpt-pdfs/deploys
drag the whole forms folder into the drag and drop area



# Updates changes and thoughts

- Google Search Console and Analytics
- Hero logo, maybe closer to the circle and the hero image smaller
- bring some sizing down on the fonts for lists etc
- front page section titles are too big
- I need a lot of work on the typefaces, lets go with just Sofia Pro?
