# EBPT

Netlify build from
https://github.com/rileybathurst/EBPT

The intake forms and images are host on S3, this needs better documentation



# Updates changes and thoughts

- bring some sizing down on the fonts for lists etc
- front page section titles are too big
- when the menu opens and closes it should go darker
- could be weird overkill but it's probably pretty easy to check the time in california and add an open or closed to the hours
- move the logo svg to a component
- possibly run the image on a production build for when they are offline or just not pull them constantly to myself
- Can I take all the regular pages into a layout to remove a bunch of imports and duplications?
- 404 page
- the year in the footer is hard coded
- Do all the A11y checks

## Notes

- Google Search Console runs through a meta tag as an alternate as the DNS was not working
