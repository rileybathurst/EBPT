# EBPT

Netlify build from
https://github.com/rileybathurst/EBPT

The intake forms and images are hosted on S3, this needs better documentation

# Updates changes and thoughts

- bring some sizing down on the fonts for lists etc
- front page section titles are too big
- could be weird overkill but it's probably pretty easy to check the time in california and add an open or closed to the hours
- Can I take all the regular pages into a layout to remove a bunch of imports and duplications?
- Some of the back pages are feeling hard to read in brandon grotesque, I think I should simplify
- the offerings page title spans two rows that is probably fixable

## Notes

- Google Search Console runs through a meta tag as an alternate as the DNS was not working
